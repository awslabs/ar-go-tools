The dataflow package implements the core of the dataflow analysis. In order to run the taint or the backwards
analysis, you should first run the steps to build the inter-procedural dataflow graph.

The first object to build is an instance of the [AnalyzerState] with some basic analyses's results already computed.
Assuming you have a program prog, configuration cfg and logger log, you can build an initialized state for your program
using the [NewInitializedAnalyzerState] function:

	state, err := dataflow.NewInitializedAnalyzerState(log, cfg, prog)

This initilization runs the pointer analysis on the program, as well as a scanning step for global variables, interface
method implementations and variable bounding information.

To build the dataflow summary of a single function, run the [SingleFunctionAnalysis] function, which runs the
intra-procedural analysis on the function:

	id := 0 // some id for the summary
	isEntryPoint // some function that identifies entry points for your analyses
	postBlockCallBack // optional, some function that get called after each block is analyzed
	shouldBuildSummary // this indicates when the summary should be built, as opposed to simply be created
	dataflow.SingleFunctionAnalysis(state, function, shouldBuildSummary, id, isEntryPoint, postBlockCallback)
*/
