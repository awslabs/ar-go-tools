// PROPOSED API DESIGN

// Represents the state required to answer queries for a particular program. Internally, holds
// the escape summaries of each analyzed `ssa.Function`. Summaries are bottom-up, but useful
// locality information requires tracking information from callers (e.g. whether a particular
// argument is allocated locally). Rather than baking in a particular context-sensitivity, this
// interface gives the client the ability to control how context-sensitivity is handled. In
// particular, an EscapeCallContext encodes information about the calling context, as it is
// relevant to locality.
//
// This calling context can be used to compute the instruction locality, defined as whether
// each instruction only manipulates local information, for a particular function.
// This process also computes, for each callsite in a function, the context the callee
// will be called under, assuming that edge is traversed. (These operations are combined because
// they use an identical, expensive monotone convergence loop internally.) The callsite information
// is initially a `EscapeCallsiteInfo`, which is generic for all callees. It can be resolved into
// a EscapeCallContext for a particular specific callee function. Effectively, an EscapeCallsiteInfo
// represents the context from the callers perspective, whereas the EscapeCallContext represents the
// same info from the callee's perspective.
//
// The `Merge()` operation on a EscapeCallContext can be used to avoid a blowup in the number of
// contexts. Merging multiple contexts is monotone, and the `Matches()` method can be used to detect
// convergence in the presence of recursive functions. (Note, the context returned by
// ComputeArbitraryContext is not a unit of Merge; it should not be used to initialize a convergence loop.)
type EscapeAnalysisState2 interface {
	// Ensures only the escape analysis implement this interface. Returns true.

	// Returns whether the escape analysis has a summary for f
	IsSummarized(f *ssa.Function) bool
	// Computes a call context for f assuming it could be called from anywhere. This is conservative, and
	// will result in less locality than if a correct call context is provided. If there are no arguments
	// (such as for main), then there is no loss of precision.
	ComputeArbitraryContext(f *ssa.Function) EscapeCallContext
	// Computes locality and callsite information for a function, given a particular calling context.
	// This internally performs a potentially expensive flow-sensitive monotone convergence loop. The
	// resulting locality map contains a true value for each instruction that is provably local, and false
	// for instructions that may access shared memory. The callsite infos must be resolved for each
	// possible concrete callee; see `EscapeCallsiteInfo.Resolve()`. Only calls to non-builtins are
	// available in `callsiteInfo`.

// Represents a call context, but from the caller's perspective at a particular

// implementation of an interface call), but may be `Resolve`d for a particular
