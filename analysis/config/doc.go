Package config provides a simple way to manage configuration files.

Use [Load](filename) to load a configuration from a specific filename.

Use [SetGlobalConfig](filename) to set filename as the global config, and then [LoadGlobal]() to load the global config.

A config file should be in yaml or json format. The top-level fields can be any of the fields defined in the Config
struct type. The other fields  are defined by the types of the fields of [Config] and nested struct types.
For example, a valid config file is as follows:
options:

	log-level: 5

taint-tracking-problems:

	    -
		  sinks:
		    - package: fmt
	          method: Printf

		  sources:
		     - method: Read

# Identifying code elements

The config uses [CodeIdentifier] to identify specific code entities. For example, sinks and sources are CodeIdentifiers
which identifies specific functions in specific packages, or types, etc..
An important feature of the code identifiers is that the string specifications are seen as regexes if they can be
compiled to regexes, otherwise they are strings.

# Unsafe options

All the options that might affect the soundness of the results are prefixed by `unsafe-`, except for the configuration
options where the user provides function summaries (where it is assumed the user have soundly summarized the functions).
